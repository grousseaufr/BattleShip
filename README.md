# BattleShip
Console application developed with .Net Framework 4.7.2

By default, only 2 ships are added in order to be able to finish a game more quickly.

It's possible to add all ships by uncommenting the code in Player's constructor (line 33/34/35).

Ship's positions are defined in ShipPlacementSetup in Player class.
